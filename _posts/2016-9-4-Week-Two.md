title: Week Two


1. What did I do last week?
This week we spent the first two classes discussing solution strategies for the collatz project and introducing the class to the various steps required to set up, test, and submit our solutions. One of the more  heavily focused on areas was caching where Professor Downing discussed eager, lazy, and meta caching in the context of the 3n+1 problem. For the third class we discussed the difference between "L" and "R" values in C++ using the ++ operator as an example, as well as the usage of exceptions in the control flow of our programs.
This was also the first week in which readings were assigned so I read through the approximately 40 pages that comprised chapters 1 and 2 of our object oriented programming book as well as a couple lengthy online articles about collegiate success and happiness. The most surprising part of the readings happened to be the target audience of our textbook, as the book seems to heavily focus at convincing it's readers that  Object Oriented Programming is a worthwhile paradigm while almost all modern programming students were introduced to programming through object oriented languages.

2. What was in my way?
Since I finished the solution rather quickly, I have few tasks that I can create issues for. I am having trouble of thinking up enough issues to solve to satisfy the 15 issue requirement for the project.

3. What will I do next week?
I will finish the unit testing and acceptance testing side of the project as well as submitting my final solution. 


Pick of the week :
Since this blog is written in markdown, I've found this online markdown editor to be a very helpful resource [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/editor)
