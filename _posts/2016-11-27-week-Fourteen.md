**1. What did I do last week?** 
<br>
Thursday was Thanksgiving day so we did not have to attend class on Wednesday or Friday. On Monday however, we focused on dynamic binding in Java and C++. Since I missed class on Wednesday and Friday last week while attending the Facebook Global Finals Hackathon, I spent some of this free time communicating with a couple of my peers about the missed lecture and trying to learn whatever lessons I missed while I was out of town 

**2. What was in my way?** 
<br>
There wasn't really anything to do for object oriented programming this week so I did not have any significant roadblocks. Since I missed several classes last week though, I had a significant amount of work to complete early in the week to make up assignments and a test and this accelerated schedule did make it difficult to start preparing for the second object oriented programming exam early

**3. What will I do next week?** 
<br>
This will be the final week of the course and also feature our final exam so I will likely focus entirely on studying for the exam and creating a cheet sheet. 


**Tip of the week :** 
<br>
I've found that the best way for me to study for exams in these classes is to 

1. Quiz myself using the class quizzes on canvas 
2. Read through my personal class notes 
3. Review each canvas quiz that gave me trouble the first time 
4. Read through the posted class notes on piazza and github
5. Review each canvas quiz again 
6. Read through all non-project specific piazza posts 
7. Read all of the posted example c++ files covered in class 
8. Review each canvas quiz 
9. Skim through the posted class notes on piazza and github
10. Skim through my personal class notes 
11. Review any posted cheat sheets 
12. Create my own cheet sheet or utilize a quality posted cheat sheet as a base and modify it as needed
