**1. What did I do last week?** 
<br>
I attended class Monday and Wednesday and then took the exam Thursday. Naturally I also mixed in quite a bit of studying for the exam using the method I posted in one of my earlier blog entries.

**2. Class Retrospective**
I started the first week of the course excited to learn about all of the different design patterns and object oriented principles through this course, but rather found myself in a C++ language class that felt like a flashback to Pointers 101 in Operating Systems. This foundational material actually helped me to finally solidify the content and learn the language early on while weekly readings about object oriented principles built hope for more advanced lessons once we all became comfortable with c++. However, this hope was never realized during the course, as the readings simply did not connect to most of the lectures, to the in class quizzes, or to even a single exam question. I definitely enjoyed Professor Downing's choice to teach through real code examples and real tests, but the cold calling during these examples often turned into the student becoming a prop for the lecture whenever they couldn't keep up with the rapid pace of the class. That being said, the course took a seriously deep dive into the object life cycle and the thought process behind many different stl functions and data structures, so I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to get and incredibly solid foundation in C++ along with some sample content about object oriented programming.
