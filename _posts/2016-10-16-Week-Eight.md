title: Week Eight
---
**1. What did I do last week?** 
<br>
This was the first week where we were introduced to the memory management side of C++ and several convention based strategies that help to reduce the risk of memory leaks. Although I'd actually used C to build virtual memory into Pintos for my OS course and utilized the heap for several C++ projects for my Robotics FRI course, Professor Downing's very detailed approach to the intricacies of the language helped me to develop a much better understanding of the process than I previously had. In addition to the classes, I also joined up with George Farcasiu for the Allocator project and met to start work on the project. Partnering with George has definitely worked out well so far, as he has been very generous in teaching me his Github workflow which utilizes several features and strategies that I was not previously aware of such as the ability to rebase branches.

**2. What was in my way?** 
<br>
Time is always my biggest challenge when approaching the coursework, as it seems that my other courses never want to let up and I am still in the process of interviewing for summer internships. Other than the scarcity of time to work on the project and readings, the only real difficulty that I have with the material is building an understanding of C++'s decision to slice subtypes that are initialized into a supertype variable when copying the object while having an alternative polymorphic behavior when pointers to each type are used and dereferenced.


**3. What will I do next week?** 
<br>
Pretty much the only thing I'll have time to work on is the project, but since I've already worked on a similar project for OS I am not especially worried about my ability to solve the problem.


**Pick of the week :** 
<br>
I've recently started to need a better text editor for my CS theory courses and made the foray into learning LaTEX. Although it can be quite a bit more complicated than word, I've found that using TexMaker as my editor and pdf viewer significantly decreased the learning curve and sped up my writing process.
