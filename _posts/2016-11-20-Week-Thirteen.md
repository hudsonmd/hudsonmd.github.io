**1. What did I do last week?** 
<br>
I attended class on monday where we mostly focused on final tips for the life project and were introduced to the clone method, however, I missed class Wednesday and Friday to compete in the Facebook Global Hackathon Finals. Prior to leaving I finished the life project on Tuesday by myself since my trip to the hackathon did not leave me enough time to coordinate and meet with a partner. At the hackathon my team and I created a solution to crowdsource the search for stolen vehicles, lost children from amber alerts, and lost eldery from silver alerts by building an ios application that would scan for license plates entered by the police as stolen or being searched for and the accompanying desktop application that would notify the police of a spotted vehicle. Our idea was that if we could build this functionality into an applicaiton in a way that it could be implemented as a background option in google maps or uber then many of the professional drivers that already mount their smartphones on their windshield could become new search points for the lost vehicles and the people inside of them without any effort or cost to the driver. Our solution got us to the final round within this hackathon, as the number of teams were pruned from 18 to 8 and if anyone is interested in watching our presenation it is at about the 22:00 minute mark at facebook.com/hackathon.

**2. What was in my way?** 
<br>
I had to travel for half of the week and therefore had significantly less time to work on the project and an early deadline before I would lose the ability to work. Additionally, because of my limited availability I had to do the project entirely by myself which increased the difficulty and time requirement.

**3. What will I do next week?** 
<br>
I will catch up on the class I missed and begin studying for our last test


**Tip of the week :** 
<br>
There is a really cool OCR library called Open ALPR that specializes in license plate recognition. It is surprisingly accurate on still photos and can even read license plated from other countries on clear videos. Part of the fun for this library is that it can be manually run on a personal server that you set up or used as a RESTful web api, thereby allowing people to experiment with it easily with rest for free and then transitioning to a free self-hosted service or paid api plan depending on the project's rate of request.
