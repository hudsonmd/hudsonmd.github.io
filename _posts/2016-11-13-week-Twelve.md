**1. What did I do last week?** 
<br>
The fifth project, life, was released and I started reviewing the project specification and planning an initial implementation. The project spec seemed a little incomplete so I held off on actually implementing the program and since I will be out of town next week I decided to not work with a partner on the project since I would not be able to meet for 75% of the time. During class we focused a lot on how to create data structures that hold polymorphic information and overloading methods between parent and child classes. With the introduction of method overloading within the class hierarchy and its many many special case rules, I also came to the realization that most of the complaints we have about c++ stem from developers not being able to abstract out the implementation details of the language from the syntax. I'm sure many c++ users consider this a feature and enjoy the power of move and copy constructors, but it seems to me that most of the complexity in copy and move constructors could be much better solved by adding certain keywords to variable declarations and as I'm writing this I wonder if the "virtual" keyword we will learn next week will solve this problem.

**2. What was in my way?** 
<br>
The project specification for life doesn't actually show example output and I had to wait for another student to post their .out file before I could understand what the project actually wanted. I also don't have a lot of clarity about what the correct copy and move constructors are because we went through so many wrong examples it became somewhat difficult to differentiate a correct implementation and an incorrect implementation. I also am quite concernedabout the clone method's role in the project despite Professor Downing's assurances that all will be explained next week, as I will be out of town for the Facebook Global Hackathon Finals and will need to submit my project by Tuesday night.

**3. What will I do next week?** 
<br>
I will complete the life project by Tuesday night and fly out to San Francisco for the Facebook Global Hackathon Finals incredibally early Wednesday morning.


**Tip of the week :** 
<br>
For any UT students that lived on campus last semester and are living off campus this semester, your dine-in-dollars will expire in less than a month. For some reason UT deletes any remaining balance in your dine-in-dollar account after a full semester living off campus, which I find outright criminal since they forced us to buy over a thousand dollars worth of dine-in-dollars in the first place. If you have any large amount left there is a gift shop inside of Jester just to the south of the Wendies which would allow you to spend the remaining balance on clothes or christmas gifts rather than buying $500 worth of candy from on of the markets.
