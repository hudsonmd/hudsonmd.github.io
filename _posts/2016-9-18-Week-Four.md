title: Week Four

**1. What did I do last week?** 
<br>
I started out the week by fixing a small compilation issue in one of my collatz project files and devoting a longer than anticipated amount of time towards the assigned 2 chapters and 2 articles of reading. Since the netflix project was released this week, and all future projects give bonus credit for working with a new partner, I spoke with several other students in the course and we decided to form a small group of people whom would swap partners internally within the group. Once we figured out the logistics of the group, my first partner, Taylor Kline, and scheduled a planning session thursday morning and an initial coding session thursday evening. During these meetings we collaboratively developed the github issues for the netflix project and then created the initial project skeleton and planned out our milestones for the next wweek.

**2. What was in my way?** 
<br>
Biking back from class friday I got into an accident, which damaged my laptop, phone, and injured my dominant hand. This delayed my work on the project as I am temporarily have some difficulty typing/writing and I had to reprioritize my time over the weekend to recover and repair my damaged items.  

**3. What will I do next week?** 
<br>
Catch up for the missed milestones, which included setting up functionality to read in the cached data files and developing a dumb solution that we could utilize for our initial unit tests. 

**Pick of the week :** 
<br>
Clion is a great c/c++ ide that UT students can get for free since we are given a free jetbrains account. This was especially useful for me because I had to reinstall the operating system on my main development machine and clion included the majority of the necessary tools to work on the netflix project.
