**1. What did I do last week?** 
<br>
I mostly focused on the Darwin project, as it was the biggest time sink for the class. This project most of my time was spent conforming to the requirements rather than actually coding a solution. Since the rubrics for the projects are not kept up to date this typically requires a lot of time scanning through piazza as well budgeting the last day or two of each project to "fix" our implementation so that it can conform to new piazza specifications. In class we've started to focus on writing move constructors and move assignment operators in order to gain better control of the memory usage of our programs. I've started to understand the patterns, but will need to review what the swap and move functions actually do, as they were presented as almost magical in class.

**2. What was in my way?** 
<br>
The flooding Thursday forced my group to prepare our submission remotely, as we could not reach the Gated Dell Complex safely and this added a lot of stress to the last couple hours of the project. Also, when working on the project is is becoming significantly more annoying to combine all of our classes into a single header and source file. We are already being asked to use specific classes like Darwin and Creature, so it would make sense to allow us to have seperate files so that we can read our code much more easily and reduce the number of merge conflicts.

**3. What will I do next week?** 
<br>
I'm going to try to get a head start on project 5 since I will be out of town at the Facebook Global Hackathon Finals next week and will not have ample time to finish it then.


**Tip of the week :** 
<br>
Don't use neosporin for more than three days on a wound, as it develops a local skin allergy after extended usage. Similar effects occur with patches for software bugs.
