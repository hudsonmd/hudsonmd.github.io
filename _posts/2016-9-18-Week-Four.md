title: Week Three
---
**1. What did I do last week?** 
<br>
I developed an initial solution to the project's actual requirements for the program, then improved it with  a caching optimization followed by a range reduction optimization. During this development I also set up my various repositories, pulled the class docker image, integrated Travis CI with my code, installed CLion for local development, and went through a few more C++ tutorials.  With the acceptance test and unit test files already set up, learning to write the tests for the project was a breeze. Once I got my tests to avoid the overflow numbers, I was finally able to submit the project and await the results. 

**2. What was in my way?** 
<br>
While downloading the updated docker image for the course, my /var partition became 100% full with docker images and my linux distribution broke. I then squandered 12 hours of my project time just trying to get it to boot and ended up completing the project on a windows machine but the large size of the docker installation took a very long time to download.

**3. What will I do next week?** 
<br>
Repair my broken machine and start the planning phase/initial solution for the second project.

**Pick of the week :** 
<br>
I've been binge watching C++ tutorials in preparation for this course and the best ones I've found have been the C++ Fundamentals and C++ Advanced Topics tutorial series by Katy Gregory at [this pluralsight link](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cpp-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
